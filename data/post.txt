    - Take the json and convert into HTML with correct porperties
    - Assume this text contains contenteditable property; as I update the HTML (i.e. create new line or add text etc), it should re-calculate and re-wrap spans appropriately to keep nice structure
    - Add 3 buttons for bg change and color change and font change: THEN when I select of a specific area and click it ; will update bg color or font-color and create/delete spans appropriately for that selected area
    - If I delete text it should delete text correctly
    - Once new text is added ; if there is a word-wrap ; it should create a new br/> so that it maintains nice bg with paddings on sides
    - Allow to export it back into readable json
